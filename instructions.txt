You will need 2 Raspberry Pis for this 
One will be set up as w Wireless Access Point (AP). This is the one sending the file.
The other will be set up as a regular RPi. This will be the receiving device.

1. On receiving device: Run wpa_passphrase command to set up the wpa_supplicant.conf file in /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
2. On receiving device: Check /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections and delete all files named after any incorrect wifi networks
3. On receiving device: Run wpa_supplicant command to connect to AP
4. On receiving device: Double-check your wpa_supplicant.conf file to be sure it does not have any other APs configured 
5. Put script digitalDD.sh on the AP and note the path
6. Alter digitalDD.sh script to match the path of wirelssDD.sh for all commands and desired dropoff location of message.txt on receiving device
In digitalDD.sh script, replace MAC address with the MAC of your receiving device
7. Alter crontab on AP to match digitalDD.sh location and run every minute 

Note: Test before use. You must confirm that your receiving device automatically connects to the wireless AP device for this to work.
